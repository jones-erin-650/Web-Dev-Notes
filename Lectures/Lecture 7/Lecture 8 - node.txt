Node
- essentially a way to run javascript outside of a browser
- run java script from your computer
- core libraries
    - good at network communication
    - great platform for programming network applications
    - it's core concept is that the entire program that run nodes and any code inside node is actually single threaded, only one thread allowed in node
        - cpus have multiple cores built in, like it can do 4-8-16 things at the same time
        - so node does one thing at a time, and nothing can block that one thread
- node doesn't accept the request individually, it usually uses another server that handles requests and node processes it
- when you want to handle multiple requests, it keeps the same computer and just gets like 2 or 10 of them. this way you don't have to buy more processors that are way more expensive
    - scaling up means you get a more powerful computer, scaling out means you just get more computers of the same size
    - node is optimized for scaling out
- node package manager
    - usually working with open source packages
    - npm
- scripts
    - your entry points into your applications
    - you could just write the command node and set it to do whatever
    - but usually there's going to be a lot of entry points into your code, and you run that command seperately
    - dependencies
        - these are your libraries
        - whenever you update your dependencies you ahve to run "npm i"
            - everytime you run nmp install it creates a lock folder
                - this lists every dependencies that your own dependencies use on and it gives every single version number of their packages,
                - this is a failsafe for if some random package one of your dependencies use updates and breaks everything
        - list of dependencies
        - version control / express
            - ^ is the latest version 
        - downloaded into the node modules folders
- common js module system
    - commonjs
    - different than the es/es6 module system
    - different syntax
- nodemon
    - package that monitors a certain file path for you and if anything changes when you save it it reruns node 
    - just so you don't have to rerun everything a million times
    - but there's a lot of security bugs in it, you should only use it on the client
- devDependencies
    - a package that's not used in the application, just used in the developer's client side
    - "dependencies i --production"
