Javascript
- not related to java, just has a similar name
- more closely related to python
- loosely typed; nothing's gonna tell you if you access something that doesn't exist; you can make a variable for a string and put a
  number in it and run it as an array, it'll just try to figure it out
- interpretive language
    - a compiled langiage has you write your code, then it goes through a compiler and puts out machine code
    - an interpretive language means you ship your code to the consumer and it's run on that platform
    - on a spectrum: a truly compiled language runs on the hardware; an interpretive language has you send the actual code and put it one
      the computer you're running it on
    - every time you run it your code gets fed into an interpreter
    - uses a system called jit: just in time compiling; adds things to a cache and im confused
    - you don't actually use your python code; you use your python code to execute commands that run in c and c++ and rust etc
- javascript things
    - methods don't belond to objects or classes, they're just stored in that field
    - if you want to take that function and assign it to a variable, you can it's just living outside of everything
    - the concept of this that exists in every other language doesn't exist in javascript
    - you can totally redefine the keyword, cause functions don't actually belong to classes or object

git branches
- main branch is shipped to your clients
    - you can even use a feature where no one can commit to the main branch
- staging branch/testing branch; stuff that's being tested and out of the hands of the main programmers
- development branch is where you work; everything else is branched off of development
- make a branch with git checkoud -b [name]
    - we won't be using pull requests in this class

misc
- biggest optimization with web server programming you can make is lowering the amount of time it takes to get information from one 
  system to another
- cvn
