<!-- 
Empty folders will never get pushed to git. Git does not exactly work with files as we expect. 
- To add an empty file you call it .gitinclude. 
- When you move a file from one folder to another git sees it as deleting one file and making another with a different location

Dunno where to put this: .gitignore stuff
- having node modules in a git file is a big nono appearently. specifically like in the .gitignore
- with the git ignore file you can say that "i don't want anything in this folder, except this file, etc"
- mainly going to be using node, vue, typescript, vs code. all should go in the gitignore template you can create from https://www.toptal.com/developers/gitignore
